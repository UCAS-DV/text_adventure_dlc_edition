1You see the Vice President staring at the flag in the garden.
1"I hear that you haven't found the last page."
1"I'm sorry."
1"I truly am,"
1"I thought EMUSA could be saved"
1"and from what I can tell,"
1"I'm"
1"right."
1She points at Zeep Vorp.
1"The last page lies with him."
1"Vorpl gleeben?"
1"Give up the game Vorp."
1"We know it's you."
1You step in front of Zeep Vorp to protect him.
1"Zeep Vorp has been an enemy of the EMUSA for a while now."
1"There's a reason why we put him in the biohazard box in Area 51."
1You vigourously shake your head.
1Zeep Vorp starts laughing...
1A lot...
1"Ver zeeleem!"
1"Plob dopl vap zeee!"
1"Yick topl vop."
1No...
1No!
1No!
1No!
1Zeep Vorp was just using us to collect the pages so he could take them and become the most powerful creature in the EMUSA!
1This can't be.
1You fall to your knees in shock.
1Mr. Skellybones and Pepper go to comfort you.
1Suddenly, a mech flies into the garden and Zeep Vorp hops in.
1"Tulap!"
