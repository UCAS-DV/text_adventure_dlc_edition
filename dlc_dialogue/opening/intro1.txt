1Once upon a time,
1there was a nation called the Even More United States of America.
1It spanned from the North Pole to Hell, North Dakota to New Rome.
1Millions of different creatures lived in harmony within its borders.
1Until...
1The constitution was stolen, and somehow spread across the nation.
1The country was doomed.
1But then a heroic intern, 
1with their incredibly witty and handsome voice in their head, 
1reunified the pages of the constitution and saved the land.
1The EMUSA was at peace once more.
1It's been a year since you recieved the #20 gift card for your heroism.
1Spookyland is thriving.
1Area 51 is the great tourist attraction it was always meant to be.
1The North Pole's democracy has been restored.
1You live peacefully in your suburban home.
1Nothing can possibly disrupt your new, $20 richer, life.
1...
1Oh?
1Your phone is ringing.
1It's Vice President Palmer.
1It's been a year since you've last talked with her.
1You pick up the phone.
1PALMER: "We need you at the White House."
1PALMER: "Now."
1PALMER: "I'll explain everything when you get here."
1You grab your $20 gift card for good luck, shrug and casually stroll to the White House.
1After 4 hours, you arrive.
1You approach the entrance.
1But wait!
1Something's wrong...
1Oh!
1You didn't eat breakfast!
1The most important meal of the day!
1You hurry to a nearby gas station and after 4 hours, you arrive.
1In the gas station you see two guys trying to buy a $1.99 chocolate bar.
1One of the guys seems to be in their late teens or early 20s and the other seems to be in his mid 40s.
1GUY 1: "How about I buy this for $1?"
1The cashier looks irritated.
1CASHIER: "When I scan it, it says that it's $1.99."
1GUY 1: "You drive a hard bargin! How about $1.49?"
1CASHIER: "No, sir, I can't do that."
1The first, younger guy turns to the other guy.
1GUY 1: "What do I do now?"
1GUY 2: "Remember the super secret ultimate negotiation trick."
1The first guy turns back around.
1GUY 1: "I have a gun."
1Damn it! A robbery!
1This'll make it impossible to buy breakfast!
1Come on, let's handle this
