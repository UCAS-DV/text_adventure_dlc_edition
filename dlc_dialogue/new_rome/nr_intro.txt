1In the cabin, Mr. Skellybones fills the Prince in on the mission and the world outside of North Dakota.
1Apparently, he's never heard of anything outside of North Dakota aside from the existence of the EMUSA.
1PRINCE: "Governor Skellybones, why did you agree to take on such a perilous mission."
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "I still owed the honored one for the service he has done for my people."
1PRINCE: "And you, Pepper, why are you here?"
1PEPPER: "They..."
1Pepper gestures to you.
1PEPPER: "Helped restore democracy to the North Pole."
1The prince turns to you.
1PRINCE: "You seem to have quite a large portfolio."
`Act nonchalant`Express thanks
1You shrug.
1The prince is amazed by your nonchalant nature.
1PRINCE: "You are an amazing individual..."
1The prince turns to Mr. Skellybones and Pepper
1PRINCE: "Wait, what's their name?"
1PEPPER: "I dunno"
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "I am not sure."
1It seems that you have forgotten your own name.
1Let me remind you,
1it's...
1You hear the train grind to a halt.
1It seems that we're already here!
2You bow and then do a backflip in gratitude.
2Unfortunately, your backflip was so radical that everyone was incapcitated due to the shining glory.
2This has to be a new record for best backflip you've done.
2This kinda reminds me of the time you backflipped so radically that it caused an earthquake when you landed.
2Oh, the good ol' days.
2You hear the train grind to a halt.
2It seems that we're already here!
