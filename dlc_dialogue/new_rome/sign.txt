1You and your party decide to walk up the trail to the New Rome Sign on the nearby hill.
1You arrive about a half hour later and the sign is pretty neat.
1I'd give it a 6/10.
1Probably not worth having the Prince almost pass out 4 times out of exhaustion
1But it's neat.
1Now that I think about it...
1A half hour walk is not that bad...
1How out of shape is the Prince?
1Anyway, the sign is neat but something else catches your eye,
1the magnificent sunset over the beautiful ocean and city.
1You are mesmerized by it.
1As the sunset continues, you notice the city lights turn on.
1It's a wonderous display of both natural and artificial beauty.
1Mr. Skellybones is watching content but Pepper and the Prince are awestruck.
1Now that I think about it,
1I don't think they've seen anything like it.
1Sunsets are normal but Pepper has probably never been to an ocean 
1and the Prince has probably never seen a birds eye view of his city.
1Ha,
1losers.
1The Prince takes out an empty snowglobe from his bag.
1He replaces the crystal in his staff with it and then a beam of light from the globe projects onto the scene.
1The snowglobe shakes and glows but it then slowly dims and rests.
1The Prince takes out the snowglobe.
1Inside is a replica of the city and ocean.
1PRINCE: "My people must see this."
