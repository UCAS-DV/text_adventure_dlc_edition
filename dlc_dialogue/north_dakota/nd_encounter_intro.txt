1You wander to the outskirts of the capital.
1elevated on a seperate sky atoll from the rest of the city.
1Everything, from the clothes on the citizens to the buildings along the streets are in ruin.
1If you had a penny for every begger you notice on your way through,
1you'd have 17 cents.
1As you walk around, two people jump at you from an alley way!
1They are holding plastic spoons.
1MUGGER 1: "Outsiders! What are you doing in these streets."
1Pepper tries to answer but is interrupted
1MUGGER 2: "You know, we don't like your kind here..."
1The first mugger notices that Pepper's elf ears and the fact that Mr. Skellybones is a skeleton.
1He whispers in the second muggers ear.
1MUGGER 2: "Not because you're an elf and a skeleton of course!"
1MUGGER 2: "But because you're not from here!"
1MUGGER 1: "Yeah! The last thing we are is racist!"
1MUGGER 2: "We're just xenophobic!"
`Shake your head in disapproval`Nod in approval
You shake your head in disapproval.
1MUGGER 2: "Are you really accusing use of bigotry?"
1MUGGER 1: "Let's teach them a non-racially motivated lesson!"
1The muggers point their spoons at you.
2You nod in approval.
2MUGGER 2: "See, they get it!"
2MUGGER 1: "Thank you for being so understanding
2MUGGER 1: "Now give us all of your money!"
2The muggers point their spoons at you.
