1You and your party enter the train you just exitted.
1It's a classic passenger train fit decorated like it was the 1800s.
1You notice the conductor wandering around the train, seemingly aimless.
1You realize that you haven't asked the conductor about Zeep Vorp.
1It's a long shot but it's worth trying.
1You wave to the conductor and he comes over.
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "Raaaaaah, what do you have any knowledge about Zeep Vorp?"
1The conductor freezes and clenchs his fist.
1CONDUCTOR: "Zeep Vorp... that bastard..."
1All of your party looks surprised
1CONDUCTOR: "One day that guy decides to hop on the train without a ticket."
1CONDUCTOR: "When I told him to get off because we live in an ordered society," 
1CONDUCTOR: "He told me 'Zep veep voodal glab'"
1CONDUCTOR: "And then shot me in the rib cage!"
1CONDUCTOR: "Then he stole my damn hat!"
1You notice that the conductor is hatless.
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "My condolences for the hat."
1You nod solemnly as Pepper places her hand on his shoulder to comfort him.
1The conductor sighs and reaches into his pocket. 
1He grabs a small photo of his hat on a hat looks at it longingly.
1You and your party look at it.
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "That is a nice hat."
1The conductor sheds a tear.
1CONDUCTOR: "It was the best hat."
1You stand back and think about the damage Zeep Vorp is done.
1He can't keep getting away with this.
