1The king falls to his knees and the prince rushes to his side.
1KING: "You have defeated me, outsiders."
1Pepper points finger guns at the king.
1PEPPER: "Where is Zeep Vorp?"
1The king sighs.
1KING: "I apologize for letting my anger get to me."
1KING: "But I will only tell you where he is if you promise me something"
1Pepper points to finger guns at the king but you lower your hand, indicating that she should stand down
1She obliges.
1KING: "Please, recover the North Dakotan diamond and save North Dakota."
1KING: "I see now that you are our only hope."
1You nod.
1KING: "He is in New Rome. Our spies spotted him directing a movie."
1KING: "Son..."
1PRINCE: "Yes father?"
1KING: "Accompany them on their journey."
1PRINCE: "W-what?!"
1KING: "Aid them in their journey and ensure that the diamond returns to us."
1PRINCE: "Oh, okay."
1The prince offers you a handshake.
1PRINCE: "I suppose you're the leader of this group."
1You shrug.
1PRINCE: "You are a very skilled warrior."
1The prince bows to you and everyone in the room looks at him in shock.
1You do a little shimmy in joy.
1PRINCE: "For what I lack in combat abilities, I shall make up for in my aptitude for healing magic."
1PRINCE: "Please, accept me into your party."
1You give him an earnest thumbs up.
1PEPPER: "Welcome to the team!"
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "Raaaaaah, excellent choice, honored one."
1The four of you leave and ride the train to New Rome.
