1You wander into the town square where someone is standing on a crushed cardboard box.
1The person wears a red pin on their shirt.
1PERSON: "There is no greater evil than tyranny!"
1PERSON: "No person has the right to oppress another!"
1PERSON: "Society must..."
1PERSON: "Wait, what am I saying?"
1The person pulls out flashcards from their pocket.
1He reads a flashcard
1PERSON: "What is the powerhouse of the cell!"
1He double checks his cards.
1PERSON: "Damn it! I got my biology flashcards not my 'Yelling in the Street' flashcards!"
1He sighs and steps off the crushed box.
1You clap to make him feel better.
1PERSON: "Thank you."
