1You, Mr. Skellybones, and Pepper are on a train to...
1somewhere?
1Wait... 
1where are we going?
1You tap Mr. Skellybones's shoulder bone and point outside.
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "Raaaaaah, I believe we are going to North Dakota."
1North Dakota?!
1You blink in shock.
1You then start laughing, assuming he's joking.
1But he's dead serious.
1It seems we're going to none other than the Mythical State of North Dakota!
1I thought it was just legend!
1How do we even enter North Dakota?

1Suddenly, you no longer feel the pull of gravity. 
1You start flying out of your seat.
1MR. SKELLYBONES: "Raaaaaah! My bones!"
1You turn to your left to see Mr. Skellybones's bones flying all throughout your cabin.
1Pepper is holding on to her seat tightly.
1PEPPER: "What the hell is going on?!"
1You look out the window and it seems like...
1we're free falling off of a cliff!
1Oh no!
1I have so much to live for!
1So much narration to do!
1This can't be it!
1Oh, before we go, just know that I love-
1Wait.
1Suddenly the weightlessness stops. You look out the window and it seems like we're...
1flying?!
1The train hovers above an ocean.
1It flies up, far above the water, the cliff, the clouds.
1You see a bunch of floating islands with grand castles on them.
1As you admire the view, the conductor enters the cabin.
1CONDUCTOR: "We'll be arriving in North Dakota in just a few moments."
/
1You hear the train land on some tracks then grind to a halt.
1CONDUCTOR: "Make that now!"
1So the legends are true...
