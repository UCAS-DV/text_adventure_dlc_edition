1Welcome to Spookyland!
1The spookiest place in all of the Even More United States of America!
1It's home to 3 million monsters, ranging from ghouls and ghosts to zombies and skeletons!
1Right now, you're fortunate enough to drop by during the 85th Annual Spookyland Carnival!
1You walk through the entrance and see...
1almost no one!
1Wait a second...
1Something isn't quite right.
1This is the Spookyland Carnival!
1This should be filled with people from all other EMUSA!
1I did here Spookyland was in decline ever since Spook Skellybones got sick but I didn't know it was this drastic.
