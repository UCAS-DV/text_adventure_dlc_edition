1I'm sure you're already familiar with how health works.
1But people often underestimate how important it is to keep a cool head.
1You see, if you let your nerves get too low, your attacks' effectiveness will likely be greatly reduced.
1or worse, 
1they'll completely fail.
1If you keep cool and have high nerves, your attacks won't only be likely to land properly,
1they may even be more powerful.
1This goes for all of your attacks except your Pep Talk
1Since you're such a great motivational speaker, your Pep Talk always works, regardless of your nerves.
1The same goes for your enemies.
1So make sure to maintain high nerves for yourself, and reduce their nerves.
1Don't worry if you get too nervous,
1you will likely have items you collect from bosses or locations that you can use as hail marys,
1regardless of your nerves.
1Although, you can only use them once per battle,
1so be conservative with your item use.
1Also, if things get too bad,
1there's a minimum value your nerves can fall under.
1Although sadly, your enemies also have a minimum nerves value.
1I'll be your first boss so you can apply your new knowledge.
1In battles, you win when you down all of your enemies by taking their health down to zero.
1If you down an enemy, you get a bonus turn.
1If you and your team are all downed, you lose.
1Remember to utilize your team, because each team member will have their own attacks.
1At least, that's what I think would happen if we somehow convinced other people to join us.
1Now that we have that settled,
1let's begin!
