1You find a haunted house.
1Just like everything else in this sad carnival, it's empty, but hey, maybe it has something.
1You enter the house and witness some poorly designed animatronics.
1This place really hasn't been as scary without Spook Skellybones.
1Anyway, in a surprise turn of events, you see a very spooky zombie and a very spooky ghost traversing the house.
1You wave at them to get their attention.
1They look back and look very offended.
1"Excuse me?" says the zombie.
1I should have mentioned, waving here in Spookyland is an incredible sign of disrespect.
1You literally could've burnt their houses to the ground and they would have been less offended.
1"I can't believe you!" says the ghost.
1The ghost continues, "David, can you show them what you're made of? Heehee!"
1David nods.
1Oops.
