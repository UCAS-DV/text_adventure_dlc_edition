1Due to some unfortunate events, the government was running low on cash so they opened Area 51 to the public for tourism.
1Of course, you have to sign a massive waiver to get in because of the crazy stuff happening.
1For example, just last week they were testing to see if radiation from nuclear fission could be used for cereal production and they used tourists to test the quality of the cereal.

1I'm just kidding of course.
1They don't have you sign a waiver.
1Anyway, Area 51 has been effectively abandoned because apparently government facilities aren't too useful without the government.
