1You sneak into the alien lab, cautious as to what might be in store.
1In the room you notice a box labeled "biohazard" shaking.
1"Raaaah, we should leave" remarks Mr. Skellybones.
1You begin to slowly leave the room until you hear.
1"Vadel glorb, Veep veep!"
1You immediately rush to open the box.
1"Honored one, wait!"
1When you open the box, a little green alien in a space suit jumps out of the box.
1It's none other than your childhood friend Zeep Vorp!
1"Veedel glammon struss stap!"
1You and Mr. Skellybones laugh hysterically.
1It seems like he hasn't lost his charm
1"Raaaah, honored one, do you know this one?" He points to Zeep Vorp.
1You nod proudly.
1You then show Zeep Vorp the page of the constitution.
1"Glam veedel? Yoop zam zeedel!"
1Zeep Vorp is joining us!
1How lovely!
