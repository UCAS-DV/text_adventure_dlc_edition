1You end up wandering to the elf dorms.
1You try to enter out of curiosity.
1but you're stopped.
1"Hey! Do you have authorization to be here?"
1You turn around and see two elves in Spec. Ops. gear with a reindeer, also in Spec. Ops. gear.
1You sigh and do a backflip to try to scare them off.
1But shockingly
1they aren't deterred.
1"We are Elf Team Delta and we are not deterred by a radical backflip!"
1"Veep vorleem zap?!"
1"Raaaah, it seems like we're in trouble."
