1Suddenly, in the middle of the fight, Santa collapses.
1Mrs. Claus walks in the room.
1"Oh dear..."
1"Someone forgot his milk and cookies!"
1"It was them!" says the Elf.
1Mrs. Claus looks at you with an intimidating glare, 
1but then softens up.
1"Oh don't you worry dears, Santa will be alright. He just underwent cardiac arrest. He needs milk and cookies after all!"
1"Wait! But they atta-" the elf continues.
1"Oh pipe down Pepper! I taught you how to treat guests better"
1"Say dears, why are you here?"
1You show Mrs. Claus a page of the constitution.
1"Oh!" She adjusts her glasses. "The constitution? Of course you can have it."
1"I wouldn't consider myself a Claus if I couldn't give a gift."
1She, almost at the speed of sound, wraps the page of the constitution in Santa's hand in wrapping paper and hands it to you.
1"Merry Christmas!"
1"Mrs. Claus" Pepper interjects, "You surely can't be giving away the most powerful document in the country to some hoodlums you just met?"
1"Of course I am! This is what Saint Nick would've wanted."
1Pepper tries to think of a response but can't.
1Mrs. Claus turns back to the three of you.
1"Say, why do you want the constitution?"
1"Raaaah, to save Spookyland. I was planning to hold the government hostage but the honored one convinced me that this was the best way to do it" says Mr. Skellybones
1"Heep jap verleeem voop. Zammy zoop hop pop." says Zeep Vorp.
1You try to remember why you're doing all of this but it seems like you've forgotten.
1Mrs. Claus responds, "How lovely! Pepper, my dear, why not you join them. It would be the Claus way to do things"
1"Wait, but-"
1"Nope, you're going to help them!."
1"Fine..."
