1Zeep Vorp's mech explodes and he ejects himself out, never to be seen again.
1He leaves behind the page of the constitution though.
1The Vice President picks it up,
1"You've done good work today."
1Days later, a firework show is being held in your honor.
1Creatures from across EMUSA come together to celebrate your achievement.
1You, Mr. Skellybones, and Pepper are awarded a Blue Diamond, the highest medal in all of the EMUSA
1The cheering can be heard for miles.
1Due to his heroism, Mr. Skellybones was able to make his case to the president.
1Spookyland will be recieving economic aid soon.
1Santa's totalitarian dictatorship collapsed almost immediately after the constitution was restored.
1But don't worry, thanks to Mrs. Claus's moral support of her husband, Christmas will be on time.
1Pepper found herself at the forefront of rebuilding the devastated North Pole, and thanks to her heroism,
1the president of the EMUSA promised to fill the power vacuum.
1We still haven't found Zeep Vorp.
1He's currently the most wanted creature in the EMUSA.
1The manhunt to find him continues.
1But none of that matters right now.
1Right now you sit on a quiet, far away hill to watch the firework show.
1"Raaaah."
1You turn around to see Mr. Skellybones and Pepper behind you.
1"Thank you, for everything." says Mr. Skellybones.
1"Yeah, you helped me see that maybe the dictatorship wasn't the best idea" remarks Pepper.
1Oh, my turn!
1Thank you for a lot.
1You should me the best time a voice in someone's head can ever have.
1Anyway, the firework show begins.
1The flashing lights mesmerize you, but then you remember something.
1You remember something that brings the widest smirk on your face.
1It's not the fact that you just saved the nation.
1It wasn't the fact that you saved Spookyland from ruin,
1or the North Pole from a dictatorship.
1No.
1It was the fact that you are now $20 richer.
1And that's the story of the greatest Quest for the Country in the history of the EMUSA
1The End.
