1Mr. Skellybones collapses and his bones scatter across the ground.
1You walk up to his hand and grab the page.
1"Raaaaaah, wait..."
1You stop, curious.
1"Raaaaaah, I did not do this without a reason."
1"Ever since my father retired, Spookyland has fallen into obscurity."
1"We are simply not as scary as we used to be."
1"Our tourism industry stands on its last leg."
1"Thousands of ghouls, ghosts, goblins, and more are jobless and homeless."
1"I believed that if I could have the constitution, I could force the government to give us bail us out of this troubling time"
1Welp...
1that sucks for him.
1Too bad it's not our problem!
1"I am aware I have not right to be requesting a favor,"
1"but I beg of you,"
1"please do not let Spookyland be neglected anymore."
1You turn around and one by one you...
1start rebuilding Mr. Skellybones?!
1You sure?!
1Were you gone for the past 10 minutes?!
1"Raaaaaah, What are you doing?"
1You pick up the skull of Skellybones and place on top of his body.
1You point to him, then the page, then outwards.
1"You wish for me to accompany you to help save Spookyland?"
1You nod?!
1I'm sorry but are you sure about this?
1Mr. Skellybones kneels.
1"Raaaaaah, for as long as you swear to save Spookyland, my alliegence is yours, honored one."
1Welp,
1forgive and forget I suppose.
