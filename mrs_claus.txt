1As you enter the gift storage facility, you notice a frail old woman with a clipboard counting the presents.
1You cautiously wave at the old woman who finally notices you.
1"Hello dears. How are you?"
1You give her a thumbs down.
1Zeep Vorp sadly replies, "Verlup..."
1"Raaaah, not well" says Mr. Skellybones.
1"Oh I'm so sorry. Care for a peppermint?"
1She slowly but surely approaches you and hands you a peppermint.
1You hate peppermints but she's so sweet that you eat it anyway.
1"I'm Mrs., Mrs. Claus. I know, 'Mrs.' is quite a unique name." She chuckles.
1"I'm just keeping account of the presents. My husband has been quite stressed since Christmas is only two months away."
1"Say dears, could you help me a little. I just need to count these two shelves of presents and I should be done."
1"It's already 5 and my husband needs his cookies and milk."
`Help`Walk Away
1You oblige.
1You count the top shelves and she counts the bottom shelves.
1Zeep Vorp and Mr. Skellybones do the same for the other shelf
1"Thank you dears."
1"Please come and visit again."
2You shake your head and walk away.
2"Oh okay. I understand, you must be busy men." She sighs.
2I absolutely can't believe you right now...
