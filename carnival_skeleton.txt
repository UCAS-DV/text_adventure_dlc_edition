1As you wander you see a skeleton running a very spooky strength tester game.
1You know?
1The one with the mallet that you use to hit the thingy and make the ball go up?
1Yeah that.
1"Step right up! Step right up!"
1"Try your luck and..."
1"Oh who am I kidding..."
1"No one's here."
1The skeleton sighs.
1You approach it and catch it by surprise.
1In response it accidentally shows you an unimaginable horror that you will likely never recover from.
1"Oh! It's just a human!"
1The skeleton chuckles softly.
1"Sorry about that."
1It offers a handshake.
1"I'm Jackson Skelly and this is my Test of Strength!" 
1"There aren't any prizes because who can afford prizes in this economy, but it's still a blast!"
`Play Jackson's Game`Leave
1You grab the mallet and lightly tap the button.
1Apparently, you put enough force for the ball to fly off the machine and fall back down onto some random zombie child.
1"Um..."
1"Uh..."
1"Wow..."
1"What are you here for again?"
1You pull out a page of the constitution
1"Oh, the constitution!"
1He shivers and whispers in your ear.
1"Look, between you and me, Mr. Skellybones has it and he should be arriving soon."
1"Just please don't hurt me."
2You shrug and walk away.
2It's hard to tell given that he's a literal skeleton but you think he feels dejected.
2You monster...
2I can't believe you wouldn't play his game.
2He was clearly desperate.
2Shame on you!
