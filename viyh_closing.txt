1Well done!
1I think you're ready to go on a Quest for the Country!
1You go back to your room and call back the president to see where you should go.
1"Oh hello," The president says, still panicked
1"I've calmed down now, sorry about that."
1"Anyway, I heard that Marian already told you what's happening."
1"Fortunately, the Constitution should just be lying around somewhere."
1"It's not like it's been split apart and it's pieces have been stolen or anything. Haha!"
1You hear the Vice President whisper something to the president.
1"THEY'RE WHAT?!"
1"OKAY NOW IT'S ACTUALLY OVER!"
1"THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO!"
1The Vice President takes the phone again.
1"Okay. Intelligence suspects that the pages have been split apart by the governors of several territories."
1"We suspect them to be found in Spookyland, Area 51, the North Pole and... your house?"
1You look around to see that you've been sitting on a page of the constitution.
1Oops.
1"Anyway, go to those locations and if you can't find all 4 pages, go to the White House so we can plan from there."
1"Thank you."
1She hangs up the phone.
1Welp, I guess we're going across the country to Spookyland!
